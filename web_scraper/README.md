# Power outrage analysis - Area Metropolitana de Buenos Aires, Argentina

I want to understand the power outrage by region and hours in Area Metropolitana de Buenos Aires.
Two companies provide the service: Edenor and Edesur. 

The power outrage data is available as snapshot of current situation in a web page. I created a web scraper to store power outrage data in a database so that it can be latter analyzed.

I am currently in collecting data stage.
